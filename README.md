# Introduction to React.js and Functional Programming Concepts

## Description

This project is a tutorial on React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and efficient user interfaces. Created by Facebook, React enables developers to create applications made up of small, reusable components, making it easier to build and maintain large projects.

In this tutorial, we cover the following:

What React.js is and its core principles.
Key concepts like components, Virtual DOM, and declarative programming.
How React relates to functional programming concepts, such as functions as values, higher-order functions, and immutability.
A hands-on demonstration of a Counter App to showcase state management using React hooks (useState) and event handling.
